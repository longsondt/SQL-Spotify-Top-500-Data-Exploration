## Introduction
This project is about visualizing and highlighting interesting facts about the top 500 songs on Spotify of 2020 and 2021 by using Tableau and SQL Server. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to create striking data visualizations in Tableau, and experience in using SQL to query for information.

Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bruce5410/viz/Spotifytop5002020-2021Dashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes) to interact with the dashboard on Tableau!

## SQL queries
If you just want to view the queries, click on the Spotify(2020-2021)_Top500.sql file.

However, if you want see the results of the queries, you must already have Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS) on your computer, download the original dataset, which can be download from the link in the Source.txt file, then import it into your database.

Finally, for each FROM clause, find and replace all **dbo.** text with **[whatever your database name is]..**, and then execute the queries.
